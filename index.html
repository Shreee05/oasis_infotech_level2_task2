            <h3>Net Worth</h3>
            <p>Zuckerberg’s net worth has been fluctuating in the past few years. Since founding Facebook and making a
                series of acquisitions, his net worth rose to an all-time record of $141 billion in September 2021. Due
                in part to Apple changing its privacy policy and other controversies, Meta’s stocks have been decreasing
                in 2022. This has caused a significant drop in net worth, leaving Zuckerberg with a net worth of about
                $60 billion as of July 2022.
